# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Project

V. Isualize and Omar have given a brand-new assignment. We are asked to create for PyBer, a summary of the ride-sharing data by city type : Urban, Suburban and Rural. 
Using Pandas and Matplotlib, we will create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. Our analysis will help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. 

## Results of our Analysis

We summarize the PyBer ride-sharing data for the different city types. This includes the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type :

Based on our analysis we can say that:
* The total rides for the urban areas is the highest with the least average fare per ride and average     fare per driver.
  This shows that in the urban areas, there are many riders riding short distances.
  More revenue is generated from rides in Urban areas.
* Suburban rides generate the second highest revenue. 
  The average fare per ride and the average fare per driver is fairly more than the urban drivers.
  This shows that the riders are riding less but longer distances compared to those in the urban areas.
* The rural areas have the least number of rides and drivers.
  The average fare per ride and the average fare per driver is highest when compared to other city types.
  This shows that there are least riders in the rural areas and the rides are long distance rides.
  
We next create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type from January to early May 2019. Line plots are effective in describing data distribution over a period of time.

* There is an upward trend in total fares for all city types from January to early May 2019.
The total fares for the month of January of urban areas is between $1600 - $2100, the suburban areas is between $600 - $1300 and the rural areas is between $200 - $400.
The total fares for the month of April of urban areas is between $2000 - $2500, the suburban areas is between $600 - $1500 and the rural areas is between $200 - $500.
The total fares peaked sometime in the month of February for all the city types.

## Project Summary

The rural rides generate the least revenue.
The average fare per ride and the average fare per driver is highest when compared to other city       types. This may be because the rides in the rural areas are long distance rides. 
More drivers can be encouraged to drive in rural areas to see if this can bring a raise in PyBer revenue.
The Pyber services are most used by urban riders throught the five months.
